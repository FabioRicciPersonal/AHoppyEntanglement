Behind the giant hole in the [[2. The Beer Cellar]]
#### **Enhanced Mosaic Trap**

- **Setup**: The mosaic still contains depictions of elements (sky, hill, river, fire), but magical energy now animates the panels.

- **Mechanics**:

  - **New Effects**:

    - Incorrect step: Panel activates an elemental explosion.

      - Air: 4d8 lightning (DC 15 Dex save for half).

      - Earth: 4d8 bludgeoning (DC 15 Dex save for half).

      - Water: 4d8 cold (DC 15 Dex save for half).

      - Fire: 4d8 fire (DC 15 Dex save for half).

  - **Solution**: The verse remains a clue, but touching the correct element panels in the sequence from the poem safely deactivates the trap.

### **Alternative Solutions**:
1. **Magic Users**:
   - Casting *Detect Magic* reveals glowing patterns on the safe areas.
   - Casting *Dispel Magic* deactivates one elemental effect for 1 minute.
2. **Perception Clues**:
   - A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check shows footprints that avoided the incorrect panels.
3. **Acrobatics**:
   - Characters can attempt a DC 16 Acrobatics check to jump between the correct panels.

#### **Combat Additions**:
As the puzzle activates, **2 Animated Armors** come to life, standing at the end of the corridor. They are enchanted guardians meant to protect the secret of the corridor.

#### Enemy's
**Animated Armor Mechanics**:
- Each guardian is enchanted with the following unique abilities:
  - **Force Pulse**: Once per round, the armor emits a 10-ft pulse of force. Creatures in range must succeed on a DC 14 Strength save or be pushed back 5 ft.
  - **Magical Reflection**: If targeted by a spell, the armor reflects half the damage or effect back at the caster (saving throw applies as normal).

#### **Narrative Description**:
When the adventurers approach the mosaic, describe the atmosphere:

> The air grows heavy with arcane energy, the golden script on the wall shimmering faintly. Four panels stretch before you, each glowing faintly: a serene sky, a rolling green hill, a rushing river, and a crackling pyre. As you take a cautious step forward, the hum grows louder, and the image of a suit of armor flickers into existence near the far wall.
