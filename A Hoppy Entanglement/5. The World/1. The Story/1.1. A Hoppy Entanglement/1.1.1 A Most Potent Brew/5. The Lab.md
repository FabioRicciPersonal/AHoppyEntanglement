### **Lab Encounter: Inferno Spider – Enhanced Narrative**

---

As the adventurers solve the riddle in the **Well Room**, a deep rumble shakes the floor. A faint red glow emanates from the cracks of a hidden door in the stone wall. With a groan and a hiss of escaping steam, the door slides open, revealing a long-neglected laboratory bathed in flickering orange light.

### **Room Description**

The air is thick with heat and the acrid scent of scorched chemicals. The room is rectangular, with high ceilings that are blackened from countless fires. One wall is lined with shattered bookshelves, their contents reduced to ashes or charred fragments. A long, collapsed table in the center of the room bears the remnants of alchemical tools—beakers cracked from intense heat, toppled alembics, and blackened mortar bowls.

In the far corner, a faintly glowing cocoon hangs from the ceiling, strands of webbing connecting it to nearby scorch marks. Small fires flicker across patches of webbing, casting ominous shadows that seem to crawl.

The entire room radiates an unnatural warmth, with glowing cracks in the floor where molten residue bubbles and pops. Near the back, a pulsating magical barrier hums softly, obscuring a small alcove.

As the adventurers step further in, the flames suddenly dim, and an oppressive silence falls. The ash piles shift subtly—then the **Inferno Spider** drops from the ceiling, its eight burning eyes fixating on the intruders. With a horrifying screech, it charges forward, leaving scorched marks in its wake.

### **Encounter Details**

#### **Inferno Spider Mechanics**

- The Inferno Spider begins combat with **Burning Web**, targeting a character farthest from melee range to disrupt spellcasters or ranged attackers.
- Its **Flame Aura** activates in the second round, forcing melee characters to rethink their positioning.
- When reduced to half health, the Inferno Spider retreats to the ceiling, using its **Burning Web** to limit pursuit while releasing **Fiery Retribution** upon attackers.

### **Environmental Hazards**

1. **Molten Residue**:  
    Small glowing cracks in the floor emit bursts of molten liquid. At the start of each round, roll 1d4:
    
    - **1-2:** Nothing happens.
    - **3:** One molten crack erupts in a 10-foot radius. Creatures in range must make a DC 13 Dexterity save or take 2d6 fire damage.
    - **4:** A chain reaction occurs, erupting multiple cracks and covering 15 feet with fire (DC 15 Dex save or take 3d6 fire damage).
2. **Alchemical Explosions**:  
    If any pile of ash or alchemical tool is disturbed (e.g., hit with a spell or melee attack), it has a 50% chance to explode. Creatures within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity save or take 2d8 fire damage.
    
3. **Cocooned Adventurer**:  
    Destroying the web cocoon triggers a fiery backlash, dealing 2d6 fire damage to the creature that attacked it (DC 13 Dexterity save for half). Inside, the adventurer’s remains contain a **Potion of Fire Resistance** and a scorched journal describing their fate.

### **Loot and Hidden Features**

1. **Charred Spellbook**:  
    Found in the magical barrier’s alcove. This intact book contains _Fireball_, _Scorching Ray_, and _Detect Magic_.
    
2. **Spider Silk Amulet (Magic Item):**  
    Found tangled in the remains of the cocooned adventurer. This delicate amulet grants resistance to fire damage for 1 hour when worn (requires attunement).
    
3. **Potion of Fire Resistance:**  
    One intact potion lies on a high shelf, untouched by the destruction.
    
4. **Alchemical Reagents (100 GP):**  
    Hidden beneath a collapsed shelf, these reagents can be sold or used for crafting.
    
5. **Optional Hidden Feature – Magical Barrier:**
    
    - **Pulsating Barrier:** Requires a DC 15 Arcana check or _Detect Magic_ to decipher. Deactivating it with magic or an Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 16) reveals:
        - A hidden vault containing the **Charred Spellbook**.
        - Additional vials of volatile substances that can be used as grenades (deal 3d6 fire damage in a 10-ft radius, DC 13 Dexterity save for half).

### **Conclusion**

Once the **Inferno Spider** is defeated, the room’s oppressive heat dissipates slightly, though the cracks in the floor continue to glow faintly. The magical barrier flickers and dims, revealing its hidden alcove.

The party can now explore the room at their leisure, discovering the loot and piecing together the story of the doomed alchemical experiments. The scorched journal hints at an even larger experiment gone wrong elsewhere in the Wizard’s Tower Brewery, offering a potential hook for future adventures.
