After finding a hidden pannel opening in [[5. The Lab]]
### **Miniboss: Scorching Revenant**

#### **Encounter Setup**

- **Location**: A secret chamber behind the lab, revealed after solving the riddle in the Well Room.
- **Narrative**: The Revenant is the tortured spirit of the wizard who died in the brewing explosion. It guards the brewery's enchanted vats, its rage fueled by centuries of pain.

### **Chaotic Neutral Dialogue**

- Upon the party’s arrival:
	"Who dares disturb my eternal vigil? The vats… they must be protected… but why? WHY must I suffer for eternity?"
- Mid-battle:
	"Leave this place, intruders! I do not wish to kill, but I cannot let you pass!"
	"My pain fuels the flames! You will burn as I burn!"
- As the Revenant is defeated:
	"The curse… it weakens… but at what cost? Will I finally rest? Or will I wander these ashes forever?"
- If the party attempts to communicate:
	"You cannot understand this torment! Bound by flames, by magic, by duty… this place is my prison, and you are my distraction!"


## **Additional Narrative Threads**

### **The Brewery's Cursed History**
- The Revenant reveals it was once a wizard experimenting with brewing magic. The curse originates from a failed alchemical experiment meant to enhance magical brewing.
- Players can decide to fully lift the curse (by dispelling it using magic or artifacts) or stabilize it (leaving the magic infused with the brewery for minor benefits but potential risks).
### **Room Description**

The secret chamber behind the lab reveals a vast brewing hall dominated by massive, enchanted vats. Each vat glows faintly with arcane energy, their contents bubbling ominously. Broken alchemical tools and shattered glass litter the floor, mingling with scorch marks and deep cracks that ooze residual magic.

Above the central vat, a humanoid figure wreathed in flames hovers, its form flickering like an ember. The air is suffocatingly hot, and the stench of burnt hops and magic fills your nostrils. The figure's fiery eyes lock onto you, and its voice echoes with anguish:

> _"You should not have come here… These vats are the last remnants of my work, and I will guard them with my eternal flames. Leave now, or share my torment!"_
