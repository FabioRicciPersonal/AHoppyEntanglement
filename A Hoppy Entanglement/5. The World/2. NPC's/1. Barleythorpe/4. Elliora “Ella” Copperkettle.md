### **Brewtique Shopkeeper**

The shopkeeper of Brewtique is **Elliora “Ella” Copperkettle**, a halfling woman with curly auburn hair, sharp green eyes, and a friendly but professional demeanor. She dresses in well-fitted, elegant clothing with a leather apron for practicality. Ella is a former brewer turned purveyor of luxury brewing tools and ingredients. She has a sharp tongue for bartering but a warm heart for loyal customers. Known for her impeccable taste, Ella prides herself on curating the finest goods for discerning brewers.

Ella is meticulous in her inventory and always knows the latest trends in brewing techniques. She enjoys swapping stories with like-minded brewers and often tests new tools herself before offering them for sale. Though she can be firm in negotiations, she values repeat customers and will occasionally offer discounts to those she trusts.
