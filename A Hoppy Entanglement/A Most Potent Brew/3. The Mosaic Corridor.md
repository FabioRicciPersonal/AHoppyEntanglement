- **Setup**: The mosaic still contains depictions of elements (sky, hill, river, fire), but magical energy now animates the panels.

- **Mechanics**:

  - **New Effects**:

    - Incorrect step: Panel activates an elemental explosion.

      - Air: 4d8 lightning (DC 15 Dex save for half).

      - Earth: 4d8 bludgeoning (DC 15 Dex save for half).

      - Water: 4d8 cold (DC 15 Dex save for half).

      - Fire: 4d8 fire (DC 15 Dex save for half).

  - **Solution**: The verse remains a clue, but touching the correct element panels in the sequence from the poem safely deactivates the trap.
