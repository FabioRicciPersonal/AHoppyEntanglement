The Beer Vats
-------------

Scorching Revenant
------------------

	Chaotic Neutral Dialogue
	1.	Upon the party’s arrival:
	"Who dares disturb my eternal vigil? The vats… they must be protected… but why? WHY must I suffer for eternity?"
	2.	Mid-battle:
	"Leave this place, intruders! I do not wish to kill, but I cannot let you pass!"
	"My pain fuels the flames! You will burn as I burn!"
	3.	As the Revenant is defeated:
	"The curse… it weakens… but at what cost? Will I finally rest? Or will I wander these ashes forever?"
	4.	If the party attempts to communicate:
	"You cannot understand this torment! Bound by flames, by magic, by duty… this place is my prison,
	and you are my distraction!"
