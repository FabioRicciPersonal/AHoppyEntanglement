The Beer Vats
-------------

Scorching Revenant
------------------

	Chaotic Neutral Dialogue
	1.	Upon the party’s arrival:
	"Who dares disturb my eternal vigil? The vats… they must be protected… but why? WHY must I suffer for eternity?"
	2.	Mid-battle:
	"Leave this place, intruders! I do not wish to kill, but I cannot let you pass!"
	"My pain fuels the flames! You will burn as I burn!"
	3.	As the Revenant is defeated:
	"The curse… it weakens… but at what cost? Will I finally rest? Or will I wander these ashes forever?"
	4.	If the party attempts to communicate:
	"You cannot understand this torment! Bound by flames, by magic, by duty… this place is my prison,
	and you are my distraction!"

### **Additional Narrative Threads**

#### 1. **The Brewery's Cursed History**
- The Revenant reveals it was once a wizard experimenting with brewing magic. The curse originates from a failed alchemical experiment meant to enhance magical brewing.
- Players can decide to fully lift the curse (by dispelling it using magic or artifacts) or stabilize it (leaving the magic infused with the brewery for minor benefits but potential risks).
